Welcome to the Royal Navy Design System!
We are here to help you build thoughtful, user-friendly digital experiences.

Here’s a checklist of everything you need to get started:


## 1. Design libraries

We provide three Axure libraries which contain all RNDS components. Using our libraries saves you having to design components from scratch and, when handing off to your developers, there won’t be confusion about the components and their behaviour.


### Getting started with the Axure design libraries

A short document to help you
- Install, use and keep our libraries up to date
- Understand which library to use when
- Discover tips and tricks for working with Axure

[Download our getting started guide](/Getting-started-with-the-RNDS-Axure-libraries.pdf)

### Legacy Sketch design library

If you are still using v2 of the RNDS, you should use our legacy Sketch library.
Please note that this library is not maintained any longer and you should transition to our Axure libraries where possible.

## 2. Foundational guidance

[Read about our Styles](https://docs.royalnavy.io/styles) to understand how elements like colour, typography and spacing work, especially if you need to create a new component or pattern.

## 3. Guidance on individual components
  
We provide guidance on how to use each individual component and its variants, including any applicable Standards you may have to adhere to.

  - [Compound Timeline](https://timeline.royalnavy.io) has its own page
